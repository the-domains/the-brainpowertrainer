description: 'Corporate-Based Mindfulness Training A 6-Week Workplace Program for Stress Reduction, Emotional Intelligence, and Performance Enhancement Mindfulness meditation has enjoyed a lot of press lately. The Wall St. Journal, Harvard Business Review, Newsweek, and Time Magazine are talking about companies like Google, Aetna, Genentech- Roche, Gap Inc. and General Mills, applying mindfulness to their modern employee challenges. Why? Because Clinical research has shown that as little as 8 weeks of mindfulness training results in increased concentration, memory, emotional resilience, calm, creativity, cooperation, interpersonal connection, and immune function, as well as decreased stress, mind wondering, anger, frustration toward management, emotional instability and illness. How? With mindfulness practices, we learn the difference between discernment and criticism, between the facts on the ground and the incomplete stories we tell ourselves, and true effectiveness versus the tension caused by trying to control everything. When we understand the power of focusing our attention instead of mindless multitasking, our brains become more integrated and our mental balance begins to show in better performance and enhance team work. Each theoretical foundation is supported by a mindful exercise to bring life to ideas with experience.
